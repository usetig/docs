## Get started with Tig NPM Package

Tig is a powerful tool that lets you save context and share them with your team. Follow these simple steps to get up and running.

### Step 1: Create an account

Go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and create an account to get started with Tig.

### Step 2: Install Tig

Install the Tig package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @tigtech/tig-cursor
```

<Note>
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running this command.
</Note>

### Step 3: Login to Tig

Run the login command to connect your Tig account to GitHub:

```bash
tig login
```

This will authenticate your local Tig installation with your GitHub account.

<Note>
The login process will prompt you with an 8-character code. You'll need to go to [https://github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device) to enter this code and complete the authentication.
</Note>

### Step 4: Ensure remote repository is set

Make sure your project has a remote repository configured:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git remote -v
```

If no remote is set, add one:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

<Warning>
Tig is only configured with Github. 
</Warning>

### Step 5: Set up Tig

After ensuring your remote is set, run the setup command to configure Tig for your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
tig setup
```

Tig will automatically create a `.cursorrules` file in your project directory to configure the Tig MCP Tool. This file contains the necessary configuration for Cursor to access Tig's context.

<Note>
The GitHub app will also need repository-specific access in order to reconcile actions that happen in your repository, such as merges and rebases. This access allows Tig to maintain accurate context and history of your development workflow. Refer to the [Tig Connector Quickstart](/quickstart-connector) documentation
</Note>

<Warning>
Run `tig setup` in each project directory where you want to use Tig. This command configures Tig specifically for that project.
</Warning>

### Step 6: Upload your first chat

Now you're ready to start using Tig! Here's how to upload your first chat:

#### For existing projects

If you have an existing project with chat history, you can upload all past chats to Tig:

```bash
tig upload-chats
```

<Note>
Note that Cursor will sometimes delete chats, which can prevent Tig from extracting all available chat history. This is a limitation of how Cursor manages its local chat storage.
</Note>

#### For new projects

If you're starting fresh, simply start using your AI assistant in your project directory. 

When you commit your changes, Tig will store your chats locally:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

When you push to your repository, Tig will upload your chats to the cloud:

```bash
git push
```

### Step 7: View your conversations

To view and manage your saved conversations, go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and log in with your account.

Here you can:
- Browse all your saved conversations
- Search through your team's history
- Access context from previous sessions

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You're set up with Tig now

Continue coding as you would normally and Tig will capture your conversations automatically.
