## Get started with Tig NPM Package

Tig is a powerful tool that lets you save context and share them with your team. Follow these simple steps to get up and running.

### Step 1: Create an account

Go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and create an account to get started with Tig.

### Step 2: Install Tig

Install the Tig package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @tigtech/tig-cursor-npm
```

<Note>
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running this command.
</Note>

### Step 3: Login to Tig

Run the login command to connect your Tig account to GitHub:

```bash
tig login
```

This will authenticate your local Tig installation with your GitHub account.

### Step 4: Ensure remote repository is set

Make sure your project has a remote repository configured:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git remote -v
```

If no remote is set, add one:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

<Warning>
Tig is only configured with Github. 
</Warning>

### Step 5: Set up Tig

After ensuring your remote is set, run the setup command to configure Tig for your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
tig setup
```

Tig will automatically create a `.cursorrules` file in your project directory to configure the Tig MCP Tool. This file contains the necessary configuration for Cursor to access Tig's context.

<Warning>
Run `tig setup` in each project directory where you want to use Tig. This command configures Tig specifically for that project.
</Warning>


### Step 6: Upload your first chat

Now you're ready to start using Tig! Here's how to upload your first chat:

#### For existing projects

If you have an existing project with chat history, you can upload all past chats to Tig:

```bash
tig upload-chats
```

#### For new projects

If you're starting fresh, simply start using your AI assistant in your project directory. 

When you commit your changes, Tig will store your chats locally:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

When you push to your repository, Tig will upload your chats to the cloud:

```bash
git push
```

### Step 7: View your conversations

To view and manage your saved conversations, go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and log in with your account.

Here you can:
- Browse all your saved conversations
- Search through your team's history
- Access context from previous sessions

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You're set up with Tig now

Continue coding as you would normally and Tig will capture your conversations automatically.
