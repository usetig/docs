Tig Blame maps any line of code in your repository back to the Cursor/Coppilot interaction that introduced it. Use it to understand context, continue conversations, and unblock reviews.

## Prerequisites

- Tig CLI installed and configured in the repo (`tig setup` completed)
- Cursor integration extracting chats to Tig (post-commit gathers interactions)

## Basic Usage

```
$ tig blame src/app.ts:42
Add user authentication with JWT tokens
https://app.usetig.dev/conversations/1234?interaction=abcd
```

This prints a short preview of the originating prompt and a deep link to the Tig web app.

### Debug Mode

```
$ tig blame src/app.ts:42 --debug
[debug] Repo: .
[debug] File: src/app.ts:42
[debug] Commit: 9b8eafc...
[debug] Line content: 'return auth.login(user)'
...
```

With `--debug`, the CLI adds:

- Commit hash and blame metadata
- Candidate file paths
- Filter mode (whether matches were scoped to the file or entire commit)
- Interaction occurrence counts (if duplicates were collapsed)

## Path Variants

`tig blame` accepts relative or absolute paths.

Examples:

```
# Relative
tig blame documentation/blame.md:12

# Absolute
tig blame $PWD/documentation/blame.md:12
```

Both produce equivalent results.

## Understanding the Output

- **Single match**: simple two-line output (preview + link)
- **Multiple matches**: numbered list with links (`Occurrences in diff` only when `--debug`)
- **No matches**: CLI prints possible reasons (manual edits, missing interactions, etc.)

Preview text is trimmed to ~100 characters; open the Tig link for full context.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git blame failed` | File/path typo or blame config issue | Verify the path, run blame manually |
| `No matching interactions found` | Commit has no AI diffs for that line | Check interactions in Tig web app; ensure `tig setup` ran when the change was made |
| `Internal server error` | Server side issue | Retry later |
| `The selected line has no content` | Request pointed to blank line | Choose a line with code |
