## Get started with Tig MCP Tool

Tig's MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tool allows you to fetch the most relevant context from your project's history. 

### Step 1: Create an account

Go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and create an account to get started with Tig.

### Step 2: Generate an API key

In your Tig dashboard, navigate to the API settings and generate a new API key. Copy the key to your clipboard - you'll need it to configure the MCP Tool with your AI assistant.

### Step 3: Configure MCP in Cursor

1. Open **Cursor Settings** 
2. Click on the **MCP** tab
3. Add the following configuration, replacing `<tig-api-key>` with the API key you copied in Step 2:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tig-mcp": {
      "transport": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "https://mcp.usetig.dev/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "<tig-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Verify tool is enabled

After adding the configuration, you should see the Tig MCP tool appear in your Cursor interface. The tool will be available for use in your AI conversations.

### Step 5: Using the Tig MCP Tool

Once the MCP Tool is enabled, your model can use it to fetch relevant context from your project's history.

#### Basic Usage

Explicitly request context retrieval by asking questions like:

- "Fetch relevant context about our previous work on this feature"
- "What context do we have about similar implementations?"
- "Retrieve information about past decisions made for this component"

Implementing new features on top of existing code:

- "Explain how this waitlist endpoint was implemented and add a field to pass in company as well"
- "Show me how user authentication works in this codebase and implement a password reset feature"
- "Fetch payment processing logic and add support for subscription billing"

<Note>
The agent will decide when to use the MCP Tool based on the complexity of the task. To ensure Tig MCP is used, request to fetch context first before any implementation.

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You're set up with Tig's MCP Tool

Your AI assistant can now access context through Tig's MCP Tool for enhanced feature development.
