## Get started with Tig MCP Tool

Tig's MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tool allows you to fetch the most relevant context from your project's history. 

### Step 1: Create an account

Go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and create an account to get started with Tig.

### Step 2: Generate an API key

In your Tig dashboard, navigate to the API settings and generate a new API key. Copy the key to your clipboard - you'll need it to configure the MCP Tool with your AI assistant.

### Step 3: Configure MCP in Cursor

1. Open **Cursor Settings** 
2. Click on the **MCP** tab
3. Add the following configuration, replacing `<tig-api-key>` with the API key you copied in Step 2:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tig-mcp": {
      "transport": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "<tig-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Verify tool is enabled

After adding the configuration, you should see the Tig MCP tool appear in your Cursor interface. The tool will be available for use in your AI conversations.
