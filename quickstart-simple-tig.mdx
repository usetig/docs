## Get started with Simple Tig

Simple Tig stores your AI chats so you can search and review them later. It does not link interactions to commits, branches, or PRs.

### Step 1: Create an account

Go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) and create an account.

### Step 2: Install Simple Tig

Install the Simple Tig package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @tigtech/simple-tig
```

<Note>
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running this command.
</Note>

### Step 3: Login

Authenticate your local installation:

```bash
tig login
```

<Info>
This uses GitHub device flow. You’ll be prompted with an 8‑character code to enter at `https://github.com/login/device`.
</Info>

### Step 4: Capture chats

Use your AI coding assistant as usual in your project. Simple Tig will capture chats locally and upload them when you push if configured.

#### Upload existing chats

```bash
tig upload-chats
```

### Step 5: View your conversations

Go to [app.usetig.dev](https://app.usetig.dev) to browse and search saved chats.

## Limitations vs Tig

- No commit/branch/PR linkage
- No PR View comments
- No Tig Blame

If you need code-aware context (commits, PR timelines, blame), use the full Tig:
