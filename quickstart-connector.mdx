## What the Tig Connector Does

The **Tig Connector** is a GitHub App that automatically syncs your pull requests with Tig, providing two key features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="PR View Links" icon="link">
  Automatically posts a comment with a link to view all AI interactions when you open a PR (if interactions exist)
</Card>

<Card title="Branch Remapping" icon="git-alt">
  When PRs are merged, automatically remaps commits from the source branch to the target branch
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
The connector works silently in the background—once installed, it automatically handles all PR events without manual intervention.
</Info>

## Install the Tig Connector GitHub App

Follow these steps to manually install the app on one or more repositories.

<Note>
Share these steps with anyone who needs to link their GitHub repos to Tig without relying on the CLI automation.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- GitHub account with **Admin** access to the repository (or organization) where Tig should run
- Browser access to GitHub
- Optional: Know the repository name(s) you want to connect in advance

<Warning>
You must have admin rights to install GitHub Apps. If you lack these permissions, ask an org admin to perform the installation.
</Warning>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Installation Page">
  Visit the public Tig Connector page and start the installation process:

  1. Go to `https://github.com/apps/tig-connector`
  2. Click **Install** in the upper-right corner
  
  <Note>
  GitHub may ask you to log in first if you're not already authenticated.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Installation Scope">
  Select where you want to install the app:

  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Personal Account">
    Choose this if the repositories live under your GitHub username. Click **Install** next to your username.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Organization">
    If the repository belongs to an organization, select the org name. You must be an admin for that organization. Click **Install** next to the organization name.
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="Select Repositories">
  Choose which repositories should have access to Tig Connector:

  **Option 1: All repositories**
  - Grants access to every repo now and in the future under that owner
  - Useful for org-wide rollout

  **Option 2: Only select repositories** (recommended)
  - Provides fine-grained control over which repos have access
  - Click **Only select repositories**
  - Use the search box to find each repo Tig should monitor
  - Check the box beside every repository you want to enable

  <Tip>
  If you're following instructions from `tig setup`, make sure you select the exact repository you just configured locally.
  </Tip>

  Click **Install** (or **Authorize & Install**) to proceed.
</Step>

<Step title="Grant Requested Permissions">
  Tig Connector requires specific read/write scopes to function properly:

  - Pull requests
  - Commits
  - Metadata
  - Other repository permissions for keeping branches in sync

  Review the permissions summary and click **Authorize** if prompted.

  <Check>
  GitHub will redirect you back to a confirmation page once permissions are granted.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Installation">
  Verify that the installation was successful:

  1. Open the repository in GitHub
  2. Go to **Settings → Integrations → GitHub Apps**
  3. Under **Installed GitHub Apps**, verify that **Tig Connector** appears and is marked as installed
  4. (Optional) Click **Configure** beside the app to double-check which repositories are selected

  <Info>
  If you installed it for an organization, you can also visit the organization settings under **Installed GitHub Apps** for a global view.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Return to Tig">
  Complete the setup process:

  - **If using the CLI**: Return to your terminal and press **Enter** (or re-run the command) so the CLI can detect the fresh installation
  - **If using the web app**: Refresh the dashboard—the app should now show the repo as connected

  <Check>
  Run `tig status` to verify the GitHub App state once installation is complete.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Repository Access

Need to add more repositories later? You can modify your installation at any time:

1. Visit your installations page:
   - **Personal account**: `https://github.com/settings/installations`
   - **Organization**: Go to your organization's **Installed GitHub Apps** page
2. Click **Configure** beside Tig Connector
3. Add or remove repositories as needed

## How the PR View Feature Works

Once installed, the Tig Connector automatically enhances your pull request workflow:

### When You Open a PR

<Steps>
<Step title="Connector Detects PR">
  When you open or reopen a pull request, the connector receives a webhook notification from GitHub
</Step>

<Step title="Checks for AI Interactions">
  The connector fetches all commits in the PR and checks if any have captured AI interactions from tools like Cursor, Claude Code, or Windsurf
</Step>

<Step title="Posts a Comment (if interactions found)">
  If the PR contains commits with AI interactions, the connector automatically posts a comment with a direct link to view them:

  ```
  https://app.usetig.dev/projects/{project_id}/pulls/{pr_number}
  ```

  <Info>
  No comment is posted if there are no interactions—keeping your PR clean when there's nothing to show
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="View AI Context">
  Click the link to see a chronological timeline of all AI interactions from the PR, including:
  - Prompts you sent to your AI assistant
  - Code changes made by the AI
  - File diffs and tool calls
  - Links to the full conversation context
</Step>
</Steps>

### When You Merge a PR

The connector automatically handles branch remapping:

- **Branch Remapping**: When merged, remaps all commits from the source branch to the target branch (e.g., `feature-branch` → `main`)

<Tip>
This ensures that commits appear under the correct branch context in your Tig dashboard
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can't see the repository">
  Ensure you chose the correct owner (personal vs organization). For organizations, you need admin rights, and the repository must not be archived.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permissions warning">
  You may be missing required scopes. Reinstall the app and accept all requested permissions to resolve this issue.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CLI still warns after installation">
  Wait a few seconds and rerun `tig setup`. If the issue persists, verify that the repository is included under the app configuration in GitHub settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="403 or forbidden errors">
  Your GitHub account lacks admin rights. Ask an organization admin to perform the installation on your behalf.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="App already installed but not working">
  1. Visit your GitHub installations page
  2. Click **Configure** beside Tig Connector
  3. Verify the specific repository is selected
  4. Check that all required permissions are granted
  5. Run `tig status` to verify the connection
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
