## What is Tig?

Tig is a platform that automatically captures AI conversations from **Claude Code** and **Cursor**, linking them to your commits and pull requests. It provides your team with searchable context for every line of code built with AI assistance.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Tig">
  Install the NPM package and authenticate with GitHub

  ```bash

  tig login
  ```
  
  <Tip>
  Prefer a lightweight chat-only option? See <a href="/quickstart-simple-tig">Simple Tig</a>.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Your Project">
  Run setup in your project directory to configure automatic capturing

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/your/project
  tig setup
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Code as Usual">
  Continue using your AI assistant—Tig automatically captures conversations on commit and push
